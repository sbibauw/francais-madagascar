# Le français à Madagascar

This website was created in 2006 as a "final paper" for a university course at UCLouvain about geolinguistic varieties of French. This is the result of a bibliographic research about the variety of French present in [Madagascar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar).
